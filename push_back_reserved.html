<h2>I. &nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a proposal to add new member functions to <tt>std::vector</tt> and <tt>std::basic_string</tt>:</p>
<pre>
	namespace std {

		void vector::push_back_reserved(value_type const &amp;);
		void vector::push_back_reserved(value_type &amp;&amp;);

		void vector::emplace_back_reserved(Args &amp;&amp; ...);

		void basic_string::push_back_reserved(value_type);

		static vector vector::of_capacity(size_type);
	}
</pre>
<p>The only difference between the <tt>_reserved</tt> functions and their non-<tt>_reserved</tt> counterparts, is that
they have as an additional precondition that <tt>size() != capacity()</tt>. This means they can
omit capacity checks, and can assume that no reallocation will be required. This means their
implementation is much simpler and much more efficient.</p>

<h2>II. &nbsp; Motivation</h2>

<p>Suppose we have:</p>
<pre>
	struct X
	{
		unsigned v;
		X(unsigned v_): v(v_) {}
		X() = delete; // maybe because there is no sensible default value for X
	};
</pre>

<p>And suppose we have some work to do using a vector of these:</p>

<pre>
	unsigned work()
	{
		auto const n = 256u;

		std::vector&lt;X&gt; a;
		a.reserve(n);
		for (unsigned i = 0; i != n; ++i) a.push_back(i);

		unsigned r = 0;
		for (unsigned i = 0; i != n; ++i) r += a[i].v;
		return r;
	}
</pre>

<p>Great, works like a charm!</p>
<p>But... the call to <tt>push_back</tt> is grossly
inefficient, because <tt>push_back</tt> does a capacity check every time, and
is prepared to reallocate if necessary. Unfortunately, the current
<tt>vector</tt> interface does not let us communicate our knowledge
that the check is unnecessary to the vector.</p>

<h2>III. &nbsp; Rationale</h2>

<p>For subscripting, knowledge that checks are unnecessary <em>can</em> be communicated, by using a separate function: <tt>operator[]</tt> instead of <tt>at()</tt>.
Following this example, we propose separate non-checking versions of the <tt>push_back</tt> and <tt>emplace_back</tt> functions.</p>

<p>The name <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> is suitably long for a "dangerous" function, is fairly suggestive
of its precondition, and reads naturally when earlier in the code
there is a call to <tt>reserve</tt> that establishes said precondition. But it's just a suggestion &mdash; <tt>unchecked_push_back</tt> also seems popular.</p>

<h2>IV. &nbsp; Implementation</h2>

<p>This is a matter of copy-pasting the implementation of the non-<tt>_reserved</tt> counterparts and removing the capacity checks.</p>

<h2>V. &nbsp; Measurements</h2>

<p>If <tt>work</tt> above is changed to use <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> instead of <tt>push_back</tt>, it runs about twice as fast on my Linux desktop machine with either GCC (4.8) or Clang (3.6). Even with such textbook use of <tt>reserve</tt> immediately preceding the <tt>push_back</tt> calls, the optimizers are not nearly clever enough to optimize the checks away.</p>

<h2>VI. &nbsp; Alternatives</h2>

<ul>
	<li><p>Had <tt>X</tt> been default constructible, we could have used <tt>std::vector&lt;X&gt; a(n);</tt> instead.</p><p>Apart from the fact that this does not work for types that are not default constructible, it also means we violate the "prefer initialization over assignment" principle.</p></li>

	<li><p>Use some kind of iterator pair over a virtual sequence of Xs and construct the vector from that.</p><p>This is a very roundabout solution.</p></li>

	<li><p>Use a custom allocator for the vector which does evil trickery.</p><p>This is an extremely roundabout and fragile solution.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>VII. &nbsp; Vectors of immovable objects</h2>

<p>Because <tt>emplace_back_reserved</tt> does not potentially reallocate, it
does not require movability of the element type. This means we may use it to
populate a <tt>std::vector</tt> with a non-movable element type,
provided we can arrange for capacity somehow.</p>

<p>Making <tt>std::vector</tt> usable with non-movable element types could be
very worthwhile. Unfortunately, we could not use <tt>reserve</tt> to arrange
for capacity in such a vector, because it requires movability. One inefficient
and non-general workaround could be:</p>

<pre>
	std::vector&lt;T&gt; v(n);

	v.erase(v.begin(), v.end());
		// not clear(), because that may reduce capacity

	assert(v.capacity() == n);
		// good, can now populate with emplace_back_reserved()
</pre>
<p>But much nicer would be:</p>
<pre>
	namespace std {
		template &lt;...&gt; class vector {
			...
			static vector of_capacity(size_type);
			...
</pre>
<p>because this would let us do</p>
<pre>
	auto v = std::vector&lt;ImmovableStone&gt;::of_capacity(5);
	v.emplace_back_reserved(...);
	...
</pre>

<h2>VIII. &nbsp; Possible further additions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<tt>reserved_back_inserter</tt>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>IX. &nbsp; Proposed wording</h2>
<p>Can be provided if there is interest.</p>
