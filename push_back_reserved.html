<h2>I. &nbsp; Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a proposal to add support for <em>unchecked</em> back insertion into vectors and strings:</p>
<pre>
    namespace std {
      template &lt;class T, class Allocator = allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt;
      class <b>vector</b> {
      public:
        <i>// modifiers:</i>
        template &lt;class... Args&gt; void emplace_back(Args&amp;&amp;... args);<span style='color:#00aa00'>
        template &lt;class... Args&gt; void emplace_back<em>_reserved</em>(Args&amp;&amp;... args);</span>
        void push_back(const T&amp; x);
        void push_back(T&amp;&amp; x);<span style='color:#00aa00'>
        void push_back<em>_reserved</em>(T const&amp; x);
        void push_back<em>_reserved</em>(T&amp;&amp; x);</span>
        void pop_back();

        <i>// capacity</i><span style='color:#00aa00'>
        static vector of_capacity(size_type n, const Allocator&amp; = Allocator());</span>
      };


      template &lt;class charT, class traits = char_traits&lt;charT&gt;,
        class Allocator = allocator&lt;charT&gt;&gt;
      class <b>basic_string</b> {
      public:
        <i>// modifiers</i><span style='color:#00aa00'>
        void push_back<em>_reserved</em>(charT c);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(const basic_string&amp; str);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(const basic_string&amp; str, size_type pos, size_type n);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(const charT* s, size_type n);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(const charT* s);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(size_type n, charT c);
        template&lt;class InputIterator&gt;
          basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(InputIterator first, InputIterator last);
        basic_string&amp; append<em>_reserved</em>(initializer_list&lt;charT&gt;);</span>
      };

      <span style='color:#00aa00'>
      template &lt;class Container&gt;
      class <em>reserved_</em>back_insert_iterator { <i>/* obvious */</i> };

      template &lt;class Container&gt;
      <em>reserved_</em>back_insert_iterator&lt;Container&gt; <em>reserved_</em>back_inserter(Container&amp; x);</span>
    }
</pre>
<p>The only difference between the newly proposed <tt><i>_reserved</i></tt> functions and their existing non-<tt><i>_reserved</i></tt> counterparts is that the former have as an additional precondition that the vector (resp. string) already have sufficient capacity for the newly inserted element(s). For <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> and <tt>emplace_back_reserved</tt>, that means <tt>size() != capacity()</tt>. This means they can
omit capacity checks, and can assume that no reallocation will be required. This means their
implementation is much simpler and much more efficient.</p>

<p><tt>vector::emplace_back_reserved</tt> enables insertion into vectors of immovable objects, for which the static <tt>of_capacity</tt> utility function would be very helpful; see Section VII.</p>

<p>The 7 <tt>basic_string::append_reserved</tt> overloads would be nice to have, but can be omitted from the proposal without much impact, considering that in practice likely most use cases for unchecked back insertion will be covered by <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> (together with, for <tt>vector</tt>, <tt>emplace_back_reserved</tt>) and <tt>reserved_back_inserter</tt>.

<h2>II. &nbsp; Motivation</h2>

<p>Suppose we have:</p>
<pre>
    struct X {
        unsigned v;
        X(unsigned v_): v(v_) {}
        X() = delete; // maybe because there is no sensible default value for X
    };
</pre>

<p>And suppose we have some work to do using a vector of these:</p>

<pre>
    unsigned work() {
        auto const n = 256u;

        std::vector&lt;X&gt; a;
        a.reserve(n);
        for (unsigned i = 0; i != n; ++i) a.push_back(i);

        unsigned r = 0;
        for (unsigned i = 0; i != n; ++i) r += a[i].v;
        return r;
    }
</pre>

<p>Great, works like a charm!</p>
<p>But... the call to <tt>push_back</tt> is grossly
inefficient, because <tt>push_back</tt> does a capacity check every time, and
is prepared to reallocate if necessary. Unfortunately, the current
<tt>vector</tt> interface does not let us communicate our knowledge
that the check is unnecessary to the vector.</p>

<h2>III. &nbsp; Rationale</h2>

<p>For subscripting, knowledge that checks are unnecessary <em>can</em> be communicated, by using a separate function: <tt>operator[]</tt> instead of <tt>at()</tt>.
Following this example, we propose separate non-checking versions of the <tt>push_back</tt> and <tt>emplace_back</tt> functions.</p>

<p>The {<tt>push</tt>, <tt>emplace</tt>}<tt>_back_reserved</tt> names are suitably long for
"dangerous" functions, are fairly suggestive of the precondition, and read naturally when
earlier in the code there is a call to <tt>reserve</tt> that establishes said precondition.
But they're just a suggestion &mdash; <tt>unchecked_</tt>{<tt>push</tt>, <tt>emplace</tt>}<tt>_back</tt> also seem popular.</p>

<h2>IV. &nbsp; Implementation</h2>

<p>This is a matter of copy-pasting {<tt>push</tt>, <tt>emplace</tt>}<tt>_back</tt> and removing the capacity checks.</p>

<h2>V. &nbsp; Measurements</h2>

<p>If <tt>work</tt> above is changed to use <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> instead of <tt>push_back</tt>, it runs about twice as fast on a regular Linux desktop machine with either GCC (4.8) or Clang (3.6). Even with such textbook use of <tt>reserve</tt> immediately preceding the <tt>push_back</tt> calls, these compilers are not nearly clever enough to optimize the checks away.</p>

<h2>VI. &nbsp; Alternatives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Default-construct instead of reserve.</p>
		<p>That is, had <tt>X</tt> been default constructible, we could have used <tt>std::vector&lt;X&gt; a(n);</tt> instead.</p><p>Apart from the fact that this does not work for types that are not default constructible, it also means we violate the "prefer initialization over assignment" principle.</p></li>

	<li>
		<p>Use some kind of iterator pair over a virtual sequence of Xs and construct the vector from that.</p>
		<p>
			This is a very roundabout solution that only covers the special case where all the Xs to be inserted are known at the point of construction of the vector.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>Use a custom allocator whose <tt>construct()</tt> is a no-op, then construct the vector with the full size, then construct the fake-constructed elements with placement new.</p>
		<p>This is an extremely roundabout and fragile solution.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>Wait until compilers <em>are</em> clever enough (perhaps given some guidance) to optimize the checks away.</p>
		<p>This is perhaps the most interesting alternative. We know from tools for C and Java such as
		<a href="http://frama-c.com/acsl_tutorial_index.html">Frama-C</a>,
		<a href="https://vcc.codeplex.com/">VCC</a>,
		<a href="http://nl.mathworks.com/products/polyspace-code-prover/">Polyspace</a>,
		<a href="http://www.astree.ens.fr/">Astr√©e</a> and
		<a href="http://kindsoftware.com/products/opensource/ESCJava2/">ESC/Java2</a>, that state of the art verifiers can, with
		success rate strongly dependent
		on how richly code is annotated in tool-dependent ways with pre-/post-conditions and invariants,
		prove that things like array indexing and pointer/reference operations are safe and will not be out of bounds. Such techniques could in principle be applied to C++ and the optimization problem of back insertion check removal.</p>

		<p>The Halting problem implies that these techniques are always incomplete: in general it is undecidable whether there is sufficient capacity for an unchecked back insertion into a given vector/string at a given point in a program. However, with rigorous annotation of pre/post-conditions and invariants, the aforementioned tools can still cover a significant number of cases.</p>

		<p>Thus, in principle, an advanced compiler whose optimizer essentially includes an integrated verifier could also cover a significant number of cases, for richly annotated code. But there is neither standardized mechanism nor tradition for such annotation in C++ (though "contracts" have been proposed as a step in that direction). Without annotation, the success rate drops rapidly.</p>
		
		<p>Hence, realistically, if we want the efficiency of unchecked back insertion into vectors/strings any time <em>soon</em>, we cannot put our hopes in compilers or novel ways of communicating assurances to compilers, and need a library solution that will reliably deliver the desired performance with the current generation of compilers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Abandon <tt>std::vector</tt> and use a custom container or manually managed buffer.</p>
		<p>
			Several people have suggested this alternative, saying that this is not what <tt>std::vector</tt>/<tt>std::string</tt> are for, but we disagree. Since these containers
			are supposed to be the standard overhead-free answer
			to manually managed dynamically sized buffers,
			overhead-free back insertion for known-capacity cases
			is <em>exactly</em> what they should provide.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>VII. &nbsp; Vectors of immovable objects</h2>

<p>Because <tt>std::vector::emplace_back_reserved</tt> does not potentially reallocate, it
does not require movability of the element type. This means we may use it to
populate a vector with non-movable element type, provided we can arrange for capacity somehow.</p>

<p>Making <tt>std::vector</tt> more usable with non-movable element types (such as
one may encounter in legacy code) could be very worthwhile. Unfortunately, we could
not use <tt>reserve</tt> to arrange for capacity in such a vector, because it
requires movability. One inefficient and non-general workaround could be:</p>

<pre>
    std::vector&lt;ImmovableStone&gt; v(n);
        // hopefully no side effects from default constructed stones!

    v.erase(v.begin(), v.end());
        // not clear(), because that may reduce capacity

    assert(v.capacity() &gt;= n);

    v.emplace_back_reserved(...);
    ...
</pre>
<p>Much better would be to have <tt>of_capacity</tt>, because it would let us say:</p>
<pre>
    auto v = std::vector&lt;ImmovableStone&gt;::of_capacity(n);

    v.emplace_back_reserved(...);
    ...
</pre>

<h2>VIII. &nbsp; <tt><em>reserved_</em>back_inserter()</tt></h2>
<p>.. returns a <tt><em>reserved_</em>back_insert_iterator</tt> that calls <tt>push_back_reserved</tt> instead of <tt>push_back</tt>, enabling lightning-fast <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt>-based back insertion into vectors/strings with known sufficient capacity.</p>

<h2>IX. &nbsp; Proposed wording</h2>
<p>Can be provided if there is interest.</p>
